<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/nickgonzalez42/bicycle-map/assets/41881164/2b6fe9b5-d2b1-46f9-a05b-12f6dbb73a65" width="25%">

Welcome to our Chicago-based bicycle crash tracker project! We are a platform dedicated to promoting bicycle safety and advocating for the development of intermodal infrastructure in the city of Chicago. Bicycling is an increasingly popular mode of transportation in urban areas, and as more people take to two wheels, it is crucial that we prioritize their safety. 

Unfortunately, accidents involving bicycles can and do happen, and when they do, it is essential to track them in order to understand the causes and develop effective solutions. Our website aspires to serve as a central hub for information about bicycle crashes in Chicago. By compiling data from a variety of sources, including police reports, news articles, and community input, we aim to provide the most comprehensive and accurate picture of the state of bicycle safety in the city. 

But we are not just about tracking accidents; we are also committed to advocating for changes that will make Chicago a safer and more bike-friendly city. This includes promoting the development of intermodal infrastructure to benefit pedestrians and cyclists, such as bike lanes, protected intersections, and multi-use paths, as well as educating the public about the importance of safe cycling practices. We believe that by working together, we can make Chicago a safer and more enjoyable place to ride a bicycle. Whether you are a seasoned cyclist or just getting started, we invite you to join us in our mission to promote bicycle safety and advocate for intermodal infrastructure.
